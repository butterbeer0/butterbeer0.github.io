        <h1>Privacy Policy for Super Adblock</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 22, 2024</p>

        <p>At Super Adblock, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and protection of your information when you use our browser extension.</p>

        <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>Super Adblock is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or share any of your personal information. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or contact details.</li>
            <li><strong>No Browsing Data Collection:</strong> We do not track, monitor, or store any information related to your browsing activities, including visited websites, search history, or downloaded files.</li>
            <li><strong>No Cookies or Tracking:</strong> Super Adblock does not use cookies, web beacons, or any other tracking technologies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Super Adblock Works</h2>
        <p>Super Adblock operates entirely on your device. It blocks ads locally within your browser without communicating with any external servers. This means that your data never leaves your device, and we have no access to it.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Super Adblock does not rely on any third-party services for its operation. We do not share any information with third-party companies, advertisers, or analytics providers.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>Although we do not collect any data, we still prioritize the security of our extension to ensure that it functions correctly and safely within your browser.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any significant changes, we will notify you through our website or within the extension itself. However, our core commitment remains: <strong>Your data is yours. We do not collect it.</strong></p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
